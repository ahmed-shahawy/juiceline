# Geidea Payment Module Icon

This file represents the icon for the Geidea Payment Gateway module.

In a production environment, this would be a PNG image file (128x128 pixels) 
containing the Geidea logo or a payment gateway icon.

The icon should:
- Be 128x128 pixels in size
- Have a transparent background
- Represent the Geidea brand or payment functionality
- Be in PNG format

For now, this is a placeholder file indicating where the actual icon should be placed.
