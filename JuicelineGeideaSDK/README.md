# Juiceline Geidea SDK

## Overview

The Juiceline Geidea SDK provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Geidea payment devices into iOS applications. This SDK enables Bluetooth connectivity, payment processing, and receipt handling for Geidea POS terminals.

## Features

- üîó **Bluetooth Device Management**: Automatic device discovery and connection management
- üí≥ **Payment Processing**: Secure payment transaction handling
- üßæ **Receipt Management**: Automated receipt generation and handling
- üß™ **Testing Support**: Comprehensive testing utilities and mock implementations
- üì± **iOS Native**: Built specifically for iOS with Swift

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- macOS 11.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Xcode 14.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ahmed-shahawy/juiceline.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or add it through Xcode:
1. File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter the repository URL
3. Select the version or branch

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the SDK

```swift
import JuicelineGeideaSDK

// Initialize the SDK
let sdk = JuicelineGeideaSDK.shared
try await sdk.initialize()
```

### 2. Discover Devices

```swift
// Scan for available Geidea devices
let devices = try await sdk.getAvailableDevices()
print("Found \(devices.count) devices")
```

### 3. Connect to a Device

```swift
// Create device instance
let deviceInstance = sdk.createDeviceInstance(for: devices.first!)

// Connect to device
try await deviceInstance.connect()
```

### 4. Process Payments

```swift
// Process a payment
let amount: Decimal = 25.50
let result = try await deviceInstance.processPayment(amount)

print("Transaction ID: \(result.transactionId)")
print("Status: \(result.status)")
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### GeideaDeviceProtocol
The main protocol defining device communication capabilities:
- `connect()` - Establish device connection
- `disconnect()` - Terminate device connection  
- `processPayment(_:)` - Process payment transactions

#### GeideaConnectionManager
Singleton manager for device discovery and connection:
- Device scanning and discovery
- Connection state management
- Multiple device support

#### GeideaPaymentProcessor
Handles payment processing and receipt management:
- Transaction processing
- Receipt generation
- Error handling

## Testing

The SDK includes comprehensive testing utilities:

```swift
import JuicelineGeideaSDKTesting

// Create mock devices for testing
let mockDevice = GeideaSDKTestingUtils.createMockDevice()
let mockPayment = GeideaSDKTestingUtils.createMockPaymentResult()
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd JuicelineGeideaSDK
swift test
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

## Error Handling

The SDK provides comprehensive error handling through `GeideaDeviceError`:

```swift
do {
    try await deviceInstance.connect()
} catch GeideaDeviceError.bluetoothUnavailable {
    // Handle Bluetooth unavailable
} catch GeideaDeviceError.deviceNotFound {
    // Handle device not found
} catch GeideaDeviceError.connectionFailed {
    // Handle connection failure
}
```

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 14.0+
